1. `BackupSettings.swift` - Enum and UserDefaults extensions
2. `BackupsListView.swift` - UI for viewing and managing backups

### Modified Files:
1. `ExportImportService.swift` - Added frequency-based backup logic
2. `SettingsView.swift` - Added backup frequency settings UI
3. `udxApp.swift` - Triggers automatic backup on launch

### Key Features:
- Backups stored in app's Documents directory under "UDX_Backups" folder
- Automatic cleanup of old backups based on retention policy
- Seamless switching between backup frequencies
- Backup files use custom `.udxbackup` extension
- All backup operations are async and show progress indicators

## Data Safety
